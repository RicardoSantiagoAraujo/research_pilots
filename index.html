  <h3>Welcome to our web-based pilot study.</h3>

  <p> We kindly ask you to complete the experiment only once, and to try to answer as honestly and seriously as
    possible. The results of this pilot will inform the final design of the experiment and are therefore very important
    to us. At the end, there will be an opportunity to provide written feedback directly on the website.</p>
  <p> We ask you not to share this link with friends or family, or anyone who has not received the invitation email.
